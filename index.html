        <div id="car_info">Initially, the Cobra began as a light sports car based on the AC Ace. Carroll Shelby aimed to create a high-performance vehicle, so he decided to install a powerful V8 engine sourced from Ford. The first model was introduced in 1962 and quickly gained a reputation for its impressive speed and agility.</div>

        <div id="car_info2">One of the defining features of the Shelby Cobra was its lightweight body combined with the raw horsepower of the Ford engine, which allowed it to outperform many contemporary sports cars. The Cobra became a dominant force in racing during the mid-1960s, competing successfully in various events, including the SCCA Nationals and the 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans.</div>
